# AI-Master-Gardener
AI Master Gardener is a local-first assistant that combines a conversational agent with TensorFlow crop and disease classifiers, companion planting graphs, yield analytics, and a Supabase-powered knowledge base—giving farmers organic-first guidance, visual diagnoses, and planning tools entirely on their own hardware.
